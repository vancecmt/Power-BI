# Power BI: Mastering the Basics
A collection of PDF files containing dashboards, pbix files, and xlsx files, each stemming from its respective file are showcased in this repository. The process aims to explore real datasets, transform them into dynamic and visually compelling dashboards, and extract actionable insights.
## Skills Demonstrated:
- Data import and transformation using Power Query Editor.
- Utilizing DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for custom calculations.
- Building interactive dashboards and reports.
- Data storytelling and effective data visualization.

  
NOTE: Some visualizations do not reflect the work (e.g. Bins & List) as most of the work was done in Power Query Editor.
